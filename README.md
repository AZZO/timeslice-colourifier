## Timeslice Colourifier

A simple userscript that adds per-task colouring to blocks in Timeslice.
Install a framework like [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) and install the script into it to use.
Once the extension is installed, [clicking on this link](https://github.com/AZZO/timeslice-colourifier/raw/main/timeslice-colourifier.user.js) should offer to install the script.
